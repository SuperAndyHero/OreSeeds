This mod adds growable plants which produce ores (and more) and can be planted with craftable seeds.

Plus supports ores from:
+Thorium
+Calamity
+Shadows of Abbadon
+Spirit
+Starlight River (Unreleased)
+Endless Escapade (Unreleased)

It is suggested you have recipe browser too.
This mod also has cross-mod support for luiafk's auto harvester.

Most seeds can be crafted with mushroom grass seeds (or the seeds from any vanilla potion plant) and some amount of the said ore.
Most plants will give back extra seeds

Some types of plants can be planted on other types of blocks.

(Coming soon) Recipes can be made easier or harder via the config if need-be.

Coming soon in a future version:
Auto harvesters
Growth accelerators

Also works in multiplayer!
