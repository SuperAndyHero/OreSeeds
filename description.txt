This mod adds growable plants which produce ores (and more) and can be planted with craftable seeds.

Plus ores from:
+Thorium
+Calamity
+Sacred Tools
+Spirit
+Beyond The Forgotten Ages
+Bluemagic
+Starlight River (WIP)

It is suggested you have recipe browser too.
This mod also has cross-mod support for luiafk's auto harvester.

Most seeds can be crafted with mushroom grass seeds (or the seeds from any vanilla potion plant) and some amount of the said ore.
(WIP) Recipes can be made easier or harder via the config if need-be.

TODO: Most ore seeds recipes require 20 ore and mushroom seeds at a demon altar, but recipes may vary based on the rarity of said ore.
I suggest you take some mushroom seeds to the guide or use recipe browser for a list of the seeds.

Most plants will give back extra seeds

Also works in multiplayer!
