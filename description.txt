This mod adds growable plants which produce ores (and more) and can be planted with craftable seeds.

Plus supports ores from:
+Calamity
+Spirit (Port Coming Soon)
+Thorium (Port In Progress)
+Shadows of Abbadon (Port Planned)
+Starlight River (Unreleased)
+Endless Escapade (Unreleased)

It is suggested you have recipe browser too.

Check the description of a seed for any special growth requirements.
Hold left ctrl while hovering over a seed to see what tiles it can be planted on

Most seeds can be crafted with mushroom grass seeds (or the seeds from any vanilla potion plant) and some amount of the said ore.
Most plants will give back extra seeds unless stated otherwise in the desciption.

Also works in multiplayer!

(Coming soon) Recipes can be made easier or harder via the config if need-be.

Coming soon in a future version:
Auto harvesters
Growth accelerators
